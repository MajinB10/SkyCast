# 🌤️ SkyCast

SkyCast is a weather application that provides accurate and up-to-date weather information in a sleek and user-friendly interface. Designed as my **pilot project in Swift and SwiftUI**, this app leverages modern iOS development frameworks and a weather API to deliver essential weather details to users worldwide.  

Whether you want to know the weather in your current location or any other country, SkyCast ensures you’re always prepared for the day ahead. This project showcases my journey into iOS development and reflects my commitment to continuous improvement and feature enhancement.
